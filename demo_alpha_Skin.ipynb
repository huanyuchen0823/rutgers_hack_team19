        "Rationale for Combining LLM API with Feature Extractor Model and User-Friendly Output\n",
        "\n",
        "Our project aims to create a real-time motion correction system for managing scoliosis and kyphotic deformities by using a Large Language Model (LLM) as the core analysis engine. Here’s how and why we are integrating multiple components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **LLM for Intelligent Motion Feedback**:\n",
        "    - We utilize the ChatGPT API as a flexible and powerful language model that can interpret motion descriptions and offer corrective feedback based on spinal alignment and posture.\n",
        "    - This approach allows us to tap into the LLM’s extensive understanding of human movement and posture, helping us provide feedback that aligns with physical therapy practices.\n",
        "    - By leveraging the LLM's API, we benefit from the model’s large-scale training on diverse datasets, which gives it an adaptive quality essential for a generalizable health solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Extractor Model as an Intermediate Step** (Planned for Future Integration):\n",
        "    - In addition to the LLM, we plan to use a feature extractor model trained to process raw motion data and transform it into a structured format the LLM can understand.\n",
        "    - This model will serve as a pre-processor that filters and enhances data from our wearable piezoelectric textiles, focusing on key spinal and postural features.\n",
        "    - By structuring the data, we ensure that only the most relevant motion features are sent to the LLM, making the feedback more precise and reducing unnecessary API calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Transforming Feedback into User-Friendly Formats** (Planned for Future Integration):\n",
        "    - To make feedback intuitive and actionable, we plan to translate the LLM’s output into different user-friendly formats:\n",
        "      - **Images/Visualizations**: Based on corrective feedback, we will generate annotated images or animations that visually guide users on how to correct their posture.\n",
        "      - **Voice and Haptic Feedback**: For real-time use, feedback can be outputted as auditory instructions or vibrations.\n",
        "      - **Summary Reports**: We aim to compile session-based summaries, offering users insights into their progress over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "For now, let's use the LLM API to show a demo, and further down the line, we can access the feature extractor and output model.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this code, we show a simple example of calling the ChatGPT API to help us process the collected data.\n"
